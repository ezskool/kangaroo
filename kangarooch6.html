<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a
 id="x27-670006.1"></a>Application for optimized dayplans</h5>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Several goals were accomplished while working on this teamproject. First of all an application
was created which supports a users day planning with the following implemented
functionalities:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Generate a dayplan, which is heavily optimized on completing as many tasks as
     possible
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Simple, yet powerful task management system
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Enter location data for any event in the calendar
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Full integration with Android calendar infrastructure
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Routing between events supporting a variety of time and space constraints
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Continous checking of the dayplan&#8217;s consistency and compliance
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Notification of the user for every event and deadline according to the dayplan</li></ul>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a
 id="x27-680006.1"></a>Easily reusable Open Source packages</h5>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Additionally to the functionality, many parts of the application&#8217;s structure can be easily reused
in other projects.

<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a
 id="x27-690006.1"></a><span
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Calendar Library</span></span> The calendar library provides an easy interface to query calendar data from
the Android platform. The queried data is then easily accessible via Java objects and can be
used in any Java application for Android. It can even be adapted to other platforms with very
small amount of adaptions to the library.
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a
 id="x27-700006.1"></a><span
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Routing Engine</span></span> The routing engine underlying the kangaroo application is a fully
self-contained java package. It can be easily reused for routing purposes in any Java application
which needs to access Open Streetmap data.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a
 id="x27-710006.1"></a><span
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Task Manager</span></span> The task management functionality of kangaroo is also strongly encapsulated
and can therefore be reused easily in any Java project. The storage mechanism of converting
tasks into events and storing them at a specific date can also be adapted easily to an SQLite
database or any other preferred storage solution
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a
 id="x27-720006.1"></a><span
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Dayplan</span></span> The Dayplan class as the centre of the whole application is also only loosely coupled
with the rest of the application. This means as it is also a pure Java package, it can be reused
easily and any other routing engine, calendar library, task manager and user interface can be
simply connected to the dayplan. Thus providing the kangaroo functionality in a whole different
environment and not only on the android platform.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a
 id="x27-730006.1"></a>Personal Experience</h5>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Last but not least, a whole lot of knowledge was gained during the development of kangaroo. At
the beginning none of the developers was familiar with developing applications for the Android
platform. During the last months however a huge knowledge was accumulated, including
structure, optimization and architecture of simple up to advanced applications for one of the big
rising mobile platforms.
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.2</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a
 id="x27-740006.2"></a>What to do differently</h3>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a
 id="x27-750006.2"></a>Milestones</h5>
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >An important project management method we only utilized scarcely is setting milestones. We
defined some milestones for the most important parts of the projects. However these were too
few. The more precise definition of milestones would have allowed us to wage the remaining and
passed time in the project in a more efficient manner and to assign tasks better. Therefore a
better process of creating and assigning milestones is one of the important things to do
differently next time.

<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a
 id="x27-760006.2"></a>Unit tests</h5>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Early in the development process we decided to not do unit tests. At the time there were
several reasons for that. As the routing engine and the calendar integration were the
first things to be developed, they were crucial in the decision process. Unit testing
on the Android platform seemed rather complicated, especially for code using the
content provider backend. In a discussion with our advisor, we decided that it would be
too time consuming, considering how much time already had passed for specification
and platform choosing. Therefore we decided to concentrate the time left on actual
development.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >  However, we had several situation in the development process, where unit testing would have
been useful. Many problems only became apparent when certain elements were integrated
together. Unit tests could have revealed these much earlier. Especially as we developed on our
own much more often than anticipated. This accounted for more problems whilst integrating,
which could also have been minimized by unit testing.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a
 id="x27-770006.2"></a>Bug tracker</h5>
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >Although a bug tracker is provided by github, we didn&#8217;t use it until the very end of the project.
In retrospect it would have been better to utilize the bug tracker right from the start. This
would have forced us to look deeper into bugs and better document them, if similar bugs
appeared later.
<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >  Especially in combination with unit tests the bug tracker could have improved the
development process significantly. A good approach, for example, would have been, to create a
unit test for every occurring bug. This means that there is an immediate way to test if the bug
was fixed and that it would not be introduced again later.
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.3</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a
 id="x27-780006.3"></a>Future work</h3>
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >As future projects, one can imagine many fields, not only directly concerning the kangaroo
application. Of course, some minor adjustments have to be done to kangaroo, if it should be
ready to be deployed via the Android market. The UI could be polished a bit to match the
design of modern mobile applications. Additionally some system parts can be improved, mainly
in the area of routing performance, to guarantee a smother and faster experience for the end
user.
<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >  Nevertheless one of the big strengths of the kangaroo project are definitely the amount of
easily, reusable Java packages. As the whole code is open sourced, all parts can be used to build
other routing related applications. But also integrate with calendar data, build an improved task
management application or port the Dayplan optimizing functionality to another routing engine
like Google Maps for example.
