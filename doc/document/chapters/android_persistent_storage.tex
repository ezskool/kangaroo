For persistent database storage, the Android API contains
support for SQLite databases. Any application can create
an SQLite object, which is stored on the device under
``/data/data/package\_name/databases''\\\\
Unfortunately, up to Android version 2.1, the installed
support for SQLite is 3.5.9. This means that it is not
possible to benefit from the support for $R^*$-Trees,
which was included in SQLite 3.6. This would have meant
a very comfortable way of storing location data and
retrieving positions in vicinity of a given point.\\\\
For simple data Android OS also provides an easier means of data storage:\\
A configuration-store can hold key-value pairs. Each application can only read and 
write its own stores, also it can have an arbitrary number of them.
\begin{verbatim}
prefsPrivate = getSharedPreferences(preferencesName, MODE_PRIVATE);
variable = prefsPrivate.getInt("variable name", defaultValue);

Editor prefsPrivateEditor = prefsPrivate.edit();
prefsPrivateEditor.putInt("variable name", variable);
prefsPrivateEditor.commit();
\end{verbatim}
