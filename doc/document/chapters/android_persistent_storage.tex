For persistent database storage, the Android API contains
support for SQLite databases. Any application can create
an SQLite object, which is stored on the device under
``/data/data/package\_name/databases''

Unfortunately, up to Android version 2.1, the installed
support for SQLite is 3.5.9. This means that it is not
possible to benefit from the support for $R^*$-Trees,
which was included in SQLite 3.6. This would have meant
a very comfortable way of storing location data and
retrieving positions in vincinity of a given point.
