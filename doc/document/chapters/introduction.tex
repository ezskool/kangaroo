Kangaroo was developed as a team project at the Albert Ludwig University of
Freiburg. The goal was to develop an application which knows all events and
tasks data of a user. Based on this information, the best route to attend all
events and complete as many tasks as possible, is computed. In this document,
all information which was created during the development is collected.

Chapter 2 describes the requirements as defined by the Lehrstuhl, as well as the
resulting development goals and the abstract system structure that was designed
to fulfill these requirements.

Chapter 3 contains information about project planning and the development
process. This means the initial and refined project plan as well as the
description of the development process.

The process of evaluating suitable platforms is described in chapter 4. The main
focus here lies on the three mobile Operating Systems iPhone OS, Android and
Windows Mobile. Others are also described briefly. Additionally the decision
which routing engine to use is described in this chapter, too.

The actual development process is the focus of chapter 5. Here the platform
specifics, which impact the system design, are explained. Furthermore the main
parts of the application, as well as some important implementation details and
caveats are discussed.

The last chapter then provides a summary of the work with some reflections on
the completed work as well as an outlook, how to use this for future
development.
