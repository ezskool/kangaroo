The following requirements were defined prior to the project start. The primary project goal is the fulfillment of these requirements.
\begin{itemize}
\item develop a program that generates and manages dayplans for its user
\item the program shall be location aware
\item the program needs to run on a mobile platform
\item the program should not leave digital traces of the user that can be followed by a 3rd party
\item the development should result in a coherent and usable application. 
\item this project is a first step towards the development of a more powerful application with the purpose of protection of the users privacy
\end{itemize}
In order to meet these requirements, more concrete development goals need to be refined from these from these abstract goals. These can be found in chapter \ref{chp:dev_goals}
