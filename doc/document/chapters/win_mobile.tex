Although Windows mobile is widely used in current smart-phones, it is not the right choice for this project. For an application like Kangaroo to be accepted by potential users, it has to be easy and fun to use. With the rather clunky UI of Windows mobile (prior to version 7) a big number of custom UI elements would have been necessary to create an easily usable and ''cool'' application. The fact that none of the developers has any recent .NET experience further increases the expected time of development. Furthermore the market-share of Windows mobile is constantly shrinking, and at the time of the decision (January 2010) it remains to be seen how it can compete.
