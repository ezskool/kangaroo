Tasks may in principle be considered as events with several parameters, including location and start times, not being fixed. The optimization process of a day plan is defined to try to fix the parameters of the given variable tasks in a desirable way maintaining the day plan's consistency. A task with successfully fixed parameters becomes an event and is thus deleted from the task list and the corresponding event is added to the event list.

 \subsubsection{Approaches to an optimization as optimal as possible}
 
  A task not only has variable parameters to fix but can also have a set of constraints of different types.
