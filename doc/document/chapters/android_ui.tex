\label{ssub:Basic Interface Structure}
The Android user interface is built upon an XML templating engine.
The basic interface is designed via XML templates and later on adapted
and filled with content via Java methods. Every Activity class inherits
from a basic activity class like ``TabActivity'' or ``ListActivity''.
The XML templates define a basic element of the according class also
(``TabHost'', '``ListView'').
