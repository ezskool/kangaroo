\subsubsection{Basic Interface Structure} % (fold)
\label{ssub:Basic Interface Structure}
The Android user interface is built upon an XML templating engine.
The basic interface is designed via XML templates and later on adapted
and filled with content via Java methods. Every Activity class inherits
from a basic activity class like ``TabActivity'' or ``ListActivity''.
The XML templates define a basic element of the according class also
(``TabHost'', '``ListView'').

The main window is just the skeleton with the tablist, which then
contains the active window itself. The Activities are added
via Intents into the tabbar. An important point, when entering the embedded
Activities into the application's manifest file, is to add the intent filter
\begin{verbatim}
<category android:name="android.intent.category.EMBED"></category>
\end{verbatim}
also. This makes sure, that the Activity respects the boundaries of the
main window when activated.
