All data integration on the Android plattform is done via
so called ``content providers''. These providers are the
only way to transfer data between applications, since there
is no shared space which all applications could use.

However the content provider for the calendar data is
working, but not specified in the official developers
documentation. That means that the API could change at
any time, which has to be considered at the application
design.

TODO: This is important for future development. describe shortly how the API is used, brag about how awesomely we reverse-engineered it. reference the calendar library where our calendar wrapper can be found.
