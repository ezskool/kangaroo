Unfortunately we decided to neglect unit tests very early in the
development process. At the time there were several reasons for that.
As the routing engine and the calendar integration were the first
things to be developed, they were crucial in the decision process.
Unit testing on the Android platform seemed rather complicated,
especially for code using the content provider backend. In a discussion
with our advisor, we decided that it would be too time consuming,
considering how much time already had passed for specification and
platform choosing. Therefore we decided to concentrate the time left
on actual development.

Looking back, this was not a good idea as unit testing would have
saved us a lot of time. Especially because of the work, that had to be
done to integrate the work of three developers working rather
independently from each other. We often introduced bugs again, which
already had been fixed. Several cases weren't taken into consideration
which then caused errors when using the merged code base.

These problems could have been extremely minimized with even basic
unit testing.

TODO: describe what should be done differently next time
- use bug-tracker from the start
- shorter development intervals, more milestones
- unit-tests to improve code quality

TODO: describe possible followup projects:
- use system parts to build other mobile routing related application
- refine this application, make it market-ready
- improve system parts (especially routing / routing-performance)
