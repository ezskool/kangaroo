TODO: finalize this chapter\newline

Having set up the basic routing toolkit needed to construct a calendar being more intelligent than a standard one, this chapter wants to give details on this additional "intelligence".\newline

Its core component is an algorithm to check whether any arbitrary event in the dayplan is compliant with the assumption of "standing" at a fixed but arbitrary location at a fixed but arbitrary time\footnote{the considered event of course has to have a fixed location and start time}. This compliance furthermore depends on the (estimated) existence of the possibility to use a given vehicle to reach the considered event in time.\newline
