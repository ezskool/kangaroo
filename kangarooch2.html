<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Based on the abstract requirements and the results of the brain-storming these development
goals and principles ca be derived:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The  program  should  run  on  a  mobile  platform.  At  the  moment  several  mobile
     operating systems are in use, competing for market shares. Since a consolidation of
     this market has not jet set in, the most appropriate platform for our use case has to
     be chosen.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">For the application to be location aware, the mobile platform needs to provide access
     to location data from a GPS or a radio cell based location system.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The location awareness of the application is only then useful, when it is able to
     monitor its location continuous or in short intervals without interaction from the
     user and without disturbing the normal use of other applications. Therefore a part
     of the application needs to run in the form of a background process. This results
     in the requirements for the platform to support background execution of code and
     for the application to be highly energy efficient. A too high energy consumption by
     a continuous background task would drain the battery fast and render the whole
     application unusable.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">For  the  location  information  to  be  helpful  the  application  needs  to  be  able  to
     perform routing operation such as route finding, estimation of travel durations and
     localization of meaningful places. Since this is expected to be both complicated and
     with high computational complexity, an suitable existing routing solution needs to
     be found, evaluated and adapted. This is considered as one of the most critical
     requirements.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">To  work  with  users  dayplan,  the  application  needs  a  way  to  handle  tasks  and
     appointments. In order to make the usage of as intuitive and easy as possible, the
     calendar and task-management functionality provided by the target platform shall
     be used.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In  order  to  avoid  the  problem  with  digital  traces  and  information  leakage,  the
     application  shall  run  strictly  local  and  shall  be  self  sustained.  This  means  all
     information that is used needs to be present on the device and all calculations need to
     be performed locally. No internet connection should be required for the application
     to function.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In order to make a re-usage of parts of the software or a further development of the
     application as a whole possible, the following properties need to be maintained during the
     development:
          <ul class="itemize2">
          <li class="itemize">a clean and adaptable system structure in order to enable the re-usage of single
          system parts in different projects

          </li>
          <li class="itemize">a high level of code quality to minimize the time future developers need to
          adapt and learn to use the system.
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">a detailed and well structured documentation to make future work with the
          code easier.
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">only well-known and proven open-source tools and and software components
          shall be used that do not pose any problems in acquisition or usage for future
          developers.</li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In order to make a successful outcome of the project as likely as possible, a well-defined
     and formal project plan and development process shall be used.</li></ul>

<!--l. 1--><p class="noindent" >As stated in chapter <a 
href="#x4-50002.2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: chp:dev_goals --></a> one goal for the project is the creation of system structure with a
formal and clean development process. One aspect of this approach is the creation of an abstract
system structure before any considerations towards the platform or the implementation details
have been made. The sole basis for the system structure shown in this chapter are the
requirements listed in the chapters <a 
href="#x4-40002.1">2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: chp:requirements --></a> and <a 
href="#x4-50002.2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: chp:dev_goals --></a>.<br 
class="newline" />Figure <a 
href="#x4-60012">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: high_level_design --></a> describes the high level structure of the system. The design should be self
explanatory. It implements the classical software paradigm of a distinction between three
main system parts: user interface, application logic and data-storage. Note that all
platform specific calls and interaction are abstracted through the data-storage module.
The application-logic module doesn&#8217;t need any information about the platform itself.

href="#x4-60023">2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: logic --></a> the inner structure of the application-logic is described. The sub-systems shown
here are:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Event  Stuff:  This  module  contains  the  main  functionality  of  the  software.  It  is
     described in details in figure <a

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Event Stuff Tools: This is a collection of helper-functions that solve common tasks
     for the Event Stuff module.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Routing: The routing engine and map-data management are located in this module,
     separated from the Event Stuff to reduce complexity and to impose the necessity to
     define clean interface between these system-parts
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">UI Manager: This as an Abstraction of the concrete implementation of the user
     interface. The Event Stuff module tells the UI-Manager about events that occur
     and the UI Manager decides wether and how the user is to be made aware of the
     situation. With this abstraction the application can look and behave in completely
     different ways depending an the runtime-configuration of the UI Manager.</li></ul>

     current dayplan can be sustained, given the current position of the user in time

     appointment.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Plan Bauer: This module is used to create dayplans from the events and the tasks
     in the database.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Plan  Optimierer:  This  module  can  optimize  the  current  dayplan  by  inserting
     executable tasks into the dayplan at practical locations.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Termin Vorschkaeger: This module can be used to suggest practical locations and
     times for meeting between two users of this application. This can only work, when
     the dayplans of these two users are shared.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Erreichbarkeitspruefer: This module is part of the Event Stuff Tools. It can check,
     wether a given appointment can be reached, given a certain current point in time
     and space.

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Time-Finder and Time-Filler: These are helper modules that can suggest a place
     and a time for a certain task to become an event of a certain deyplan.</li></ul>
