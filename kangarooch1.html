<!--l. 1--><p class="noindent" >Kangaroo was developed as a team project at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg. The
goal was to develop an application which knows all events and tasks data of a user. Based on
this information, the best route to attend all events and complete as many tasks as possible, is
computed. In this document, all information which was created during the development is
collected.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  Chapter 2 describes the requirements as defined by the Lehrstuhl, as well as the resulting
development goals and the abstract system structure that was designed to fulfill these
requirements.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  Chapter 3 contains information about project planning and the development process. This
means the initial and refined project plan as well as the description of the development
process.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  The process of evaluating suitable platforms is described in chapter 4. The main focus here
lies on the three mobile Operating Systems iPhone OS, Android and Windows Mobile. Others
are also described briefly. Additionally the decision which routing engine to use is described in
this chapter, too.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  The actual development process is the focus of chapter 5. Here the platform specifics, which
impact the system design, are explained. Furthermore the main parts of the application, as well
as some important implementation details and caveats are discussed.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  The last chapter then provides a summary of the work with some reflections on the completed
work as well as an outlook, how to use this for future development.
